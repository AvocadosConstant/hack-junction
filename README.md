## Challenge

### Helvar: Lighting Control with Computer Vision (1)

Use infrared and/or regular cameras for controlling and configuring lighting systems.

More accurate sensors and information about the environment are vital for automated lighting control. Cameras (especially infrared) have superior accuracy since they are able to detect still targets. Furthermore, system can be configured by using computer vision on regular images.

We provide two teams with
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B,
2. FLIR Lepton infrared cameras,
3. Sample Linux application which uses the camera to control the lights (over a REST API).

You can also use the IR cameras provided by Junction or cameras in your mobile devices. For configuration task you can access a database of sample images and the desired output.

Solutions that interest the company
We are interested in unique approaches for
1. Detecting occupants,
2. Counting the number of occupants,
3. Direction of the movement,
4. Identifying gestures,
5. Detecting windows or other sources of external light,
6. Determining the type of area (workspace, corridor or something else) and,
7. Other innovative findings.
